# Stopwatch Plugin for Redmine [![Test with Redmine](https://github.com/jkraemer/stopwatch/actions/workflows/redmine.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/jkraemer/stopwatch/actions/workflows/redmine.yml)

Minimal plugin that aims to make tracking your time with Redmine much easier.

## Features

- Adds a **Log time** menu item to the account menu (top right)
- That link leads to an overlay listing today's time entries, with a form that
  allows editing existing or creating a new entry.
- Time entries can be started / stopped from the overlay as well as via their
  context menu. There can only be one currently running entry, which will be
  periodically updated with the time lapsed since it was started. Previously
  running entry is stopped automatically when another is started.
- The hours:minutes of the currently *running* entry is highlighted in time
  entry listings as well as shown next to the **Log time** menu item as well as
  in the window title.
- Creating an entry with 0 minutes saves it in *running* state.
